I want to search a whole word in paragraph and word may end with special character. For example text to be searched is "search:" and the paragraph is "search: no search result found". In this search result start index would be 0 and end index would be 6.

Regular expression i am using is "\\bsarch:\\b" however this regular expression escape special character ':' .
